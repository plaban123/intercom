Question - What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally.
Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

Answer -

One of the projects I am proud of is improving the performance of a critical user-facing product at Blippar.

This product used to consume many microservices and generate the data that is required to be shown on the UI.
Microservices are a right way to build large systems but due to their inherent design, the user data gets fragmented.
Also, unlike a single database, performing join operations across services is complicated.

Hence, we decided to build an event sourcing system by using Debezium and Kafka, through which we could subscribe to data operations happening in these services and generate materialized views for the UI.

These materialized views greatly improved the performance of the application(by 5 times) and improved the user experience drastically.
